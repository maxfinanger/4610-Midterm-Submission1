Vehicle Routing Problem Using Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms.

## Instructions to run this project

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed, as well as the following Python packages:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- jupyter

### Installation

If you dont have the dependencies you can use this comand to install them:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Instructions

To run the algortihm you only need to press the "Run All" button in the Jupyter notebook. And then all of the scenarios will be run and the results will be shown in the output cells.

## Objective: Develop and implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve a basic combinatorial

Optimization problem in the logistics sector. Specifically, you will address the Vehicle Routing
Problem (VRP), a classic problem of finding optimal routes for multiple vehicles to visit a set
of locations.

### 1 The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) involves finding the most efficient routes for a fleet of
vehicles to serve a group of customers from a central depot. The input includes a depot, a set
of customers with known locations (and often demands), and a fleet of vehicles with limited
capacity. The process must ensure that each customer is visited exactly once, every route begins
and ends at the depot, and vehicle capacity or other constraints are not violated. The output is
a set of feasible routes, one for each vehicle, that collectively serve all customers. The aim is
to minimize the overall cost, usually measured as the total travel distance, travel time, or
number of vehicles used.
